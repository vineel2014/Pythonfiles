1) Odd/Even

2) Sum of all digits of a number:
	- You can use an iterator
	- Convert types of a variable using - int(), str(), tuple(), list() etc.
	
3) Find the divisors of a number:
	- assign a blank list/tuple:
		list = []
		tuple = ()
	- to store values in a list :
		list = list + [i]
	- to store values in a tuple:
		tuple = tuple + (i,)

4) Find out the square Root of a perfect square : example = 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 etc
	- For finding sqrt of 9:
		 1*1 = 1 - not the answer
		 2*2 = 4 - not the answer
		 3*3 = 9 - is the answer

5) Find the square root of any real number: example = 1,2,3,4,5,6.....
	- The answer can be correct to some decimal points that the user will give.
	i.e if user gives .001 accuracy. Sqrt. of 9 can be 2.999
